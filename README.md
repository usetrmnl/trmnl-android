# Android - TRMNL Display Mirror ü™û
A simple app to mirror existing TRMNL's content to your Android device (preferably e-ink display).

## üìú Preconditions
You must have a **valid** `access-token` to access the [screen content](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/private-api/fetch-screen-content) using TRMNL server API.

Here are some of the known ways you can get access to the `access-token`.

1. You must own a [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) device with "developer edition" add-on purchased
2. You have purchased their [BYOD](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byod) product.
3. You have self-serve installation of TRMNL service using [BYOS](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos)


## How to try
‚¨áÔ∏è Install the APK on your Android device.

1. Configure the API `access-token` in the app settings  
    i. üìù NOTE: Right now only `https://trmnl.app/api/` service API is supported, custom service URL support will be added later
2. Save the token and keep the app always-on with the TRMNL's display image showing.

### Limitations üöß
1. Right now, screen lock using Google's [recommended](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/awake/screen-on) **`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`** is not working on e-Ink tablet due to strict battery optimization. So, if you plan to keep the screen on indefinitely, you should set that in the device settings.
    * On normal Android tablet or device, screen wake lock should work. However it's not recommended to use it without device being always plugged-in üîå.
2. Currently the app uses Android WorkManager to schedule refresh job and it has minimum interval of ‚è∞ `15 min` between jobs. So, if your TRMNL is setup to refresh every `5 min`, you will not see it refresh until `15 min` is elapsed.
    * This can be overcome by using some clever logic or not using `WorkManager`. However, this is a OS optimized and reliable way to refresh image periodically.
