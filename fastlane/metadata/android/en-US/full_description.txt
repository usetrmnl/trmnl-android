TRMNL serves as a digital display for TRMNL e-ink devices and BYOS installations. The app connects to the TRMNL or BYOS API, fetches display data, and shows it on Android devices. It can function both as a mirror for existing TRMNL devices or as a standalone TRMNL display connected directly to BYOS servers.

Key Features:
• Token-based authentication with TRMNL/BYOS API
• Automatic periodic image refresh from the server
• Adaptive refresh rate based on server response config
• Manual refresh capabilities and option to load next playlist image
• Support for custom server URLs for BYOS installations
• Refresh history logging for tracking & validation
• Support for standard TRMNL, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and BYOS (Bring Your Own Server) configurations

The app requires a valid access token or device MAC address to connect to TRMNL services. You can obtain this through:
• Owning a TRMNL device with the developer edition add-on
• Purchasing the BYOD product
• Having a self-serve installation of TRMNL service using BYOS

The app works without Google Play Services and is suitable for e-ink tablets and other Android devices running Android 9.0 (API 28) or higher.
