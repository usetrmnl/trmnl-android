AutoName: TRMNL Display Mirror
Summary: Mirror TRMNL e-ink displays on Android devices
Description: |-
    TRMNL Display Mirror serves as a digital display mirror for TRMNL e-ink devices. The app connects to the TRMNL API, fetches display data, and shows it on Android devices.

    Key Features:
    • Token-based authentication with TRMNL/BYOS API
    • Automatic periodic image refresh from the server
    • Adaptive refresh rate based on server response config
    • Manual refresh capabilities and option to load next playlist image
    • Support for custom server URLs for BYOS installations
    • Refresh history logging for tracking & validation
    • Support for standard TRMNL, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and BYOS (Bring Your Own Server) configurations

    The app requires a valid access token or device MAC address to connect to TRMNL services. You can obtain this through:
    • Owning a TRMNL device with the developer edition add-on
    • Purchasing the BYOD product
    • Having a self-serve installation of TRMNL service using BYOS

    The app works without Google Play Services and is suitable for e-ink tablets and other Android devices running Android 9.0 (API 28) or higher.
